To be productive in any language there needs to be a way to write, evalute and debug applications. The development 
environment is free to use and can be used in any standard web browser supporting HTML 5. Alternatively this 
development client can be run as a standalone application.

### Command Line Interpreter

To run scripts as a standalone application you can download the interpreter. The interpreter requires Java to 
be installed on the host machine. Once you have downloaded the interpreter you can begin running scripts right 
away. All you need to do is specify the script file relative to the current directory.

### Development Environment

The development environment, Tern Studio, is written with HTML5 and TypeScript. It comes packaged as a standalone application 
leveraging the [Chrome Embedded Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework). Running an application from Tern Studio is as simple has pressing the 
play button. This will initiate a bootstrapping process where the interpreter is downloaded in to a harness once
this bootstrapping process has completed the source program is downloaded and executed. Stepping through the
code can be done by setting break points.
